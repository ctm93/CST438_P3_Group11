# Description
myPlants is a mobile application that helps plant owners better manage their plants. In the app, one can search for and save plant information in the database of user-submitted plants. Additionally, one can keep a list of their own plants to set and track watering and fertilization cycles as well as a notebook for each individual plant. On the home screen, the user will be able to see the current status of their plants water (watered, needs water soon, and needs water) and fertilizer schedule.
The myPlants database will be held on Firebase with the API (built on Postman) accessed through Springboot.
